In your creation heaven did decree
That in your arms sweet death should dwell
Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
The sirens are calling for me
Saved my soul thinking "This song's a lie"
Sand on the shore is so dry
Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
Brave day sinking in endless night
The age will sayâ€¦
